bin2c v0.14.0 - Windows/Linux/MAC - [FINAL]:

Windows:

-	to build run winbuild.exe

-	then to build tests run tests\wintestbuild.exe.

-	This should Generate working tests.

-	Note: since v0.2.0 the generated output will contain the name of the original files.

MAC:

-	To Build you need to make a makefile and use that in command line.

-	Note: Dont forget to use the rc file. (which will need some changes) This should hopefully allow you to have a resource section.

Linux:

-	To build you need to make a makefile similar to those MAC users.

-	Note: It is good to try to use the rc file as well if possible.
